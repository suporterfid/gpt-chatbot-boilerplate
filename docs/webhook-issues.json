It handles request validation, content type negotiation, and routing to a handler class. The new `inbound.php` should follow a similar pattern: validate the request is `POST`, load `config.php`, instantiate the `WebhookGateway`, pass the request body and headers to it, and render the JSON response.\n\n```php\n// From: chat-unified.php\n// This pattern of loading config, validating, and routing to a handler is a good model.\nrequire_once __DIR__ .

The `WebhookGateway` will need to dispatch events to a job queue for asynchronous processing. This will involve creating a job payload and enqueuing it. The WebSocket server provides an example of handling different types of events and dispatching actions based on them.\n\n```php\n// From: websocket-server.php\n// This logic can be adapted for queuing jobs from the WebhookGateway.\npublic function onMessage(ConnectionInterface $from, $msg) {\n    $data = json_decode($msg, true);\n    switch ($data['type']) {\n        case 'chat':\n            // In the webhook gateway, this would be where a job is created\n            // and added to a queue like RabbitMQ or a DB-based queue.\n            $jobPayload = ['event_type' => 'inbound_webhook', 'data' => $normalizedData];\n            // $this->jobQueue->enqueue($jobPayload);\n            break;\n    }\n}\n```"

The methods in this service will encapsulate security logic that is currently absent or would otherwise be scattered.\n\n```php\n// From: includes/ChatHandler.php\n// The security service should be instantiated with config, similar to ChatHandler.\nclass WebhookSecurityService {\n    private $config;\n\n    public function __construct($config) {\n        $this->config = $config;\n    }\n\n    public function validateSignature($header, $body, $secret) {\n        // ...
