## Documentation Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Phase 4 Section ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` contained two separate "Phase 4: Admin UI Frontend" sections at lines 369 and 508.

**Root Cause:** Backend API documentation was added later to document completed work, but used the same phase header, creating a duplicate section.

**Fix:** Merged the two sections into a single coherent Phase 4 with proper subsections:
- **4.0 Admin API Backend** (previously the first section)
- **4.1 Admin UI Structure** (previously the second section's 4.1)
- **4.2 Static Asset Serving** (previously the second section's 4.2)

**Impact:** Documentation is now clear and well-structured.

### 2. Duplicate Test Task ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** Test checklist in Phase 5 (line 757) had "Test both Responses and Chat APIs" listed twice.

**Fix:** Removed the duplicate unchecked entry, kept the single checked version.

**Impact:** Clean, accurate testing documentation.

### 3. Outdated Phase 1 Task Status ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** 14 Phase 1 task groups (lines 54-188) were still marked as unchecked `[ ]` despite Phase 1 being fully complete.

**Tasks Updated:**
- Create DB.php PDO wrapper
- Design agents table schema
- Design audit_log table schema
- Create SQLite migrations
- Create MySQL migrations
- Add migration runner
- Test DB operations
- Create AgentService class
- Implement agent normalization
- Implement config resolution
- Add audit logging
- Test agent operations

**Fix:** Marked all Phase 1 tasks as completed `✅`.

**Impact:** Documentation accurately reflects implementation status.
