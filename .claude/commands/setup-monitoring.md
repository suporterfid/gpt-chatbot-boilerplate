Help me set up the monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana + Loki):
1. Check current observability configuration
2. Guide me through docker-compose setup in observability/docker/
3. Verify metrics endpoint is working (/metrics.php)
4. Import Grafana dashboards from observability/dashboards/
5. Configure alerts from observability/alerts/
