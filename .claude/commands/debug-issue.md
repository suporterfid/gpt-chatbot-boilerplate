Help me debug an issue. Ask me:
- What's the problem?
- What were you trying to do?
- What's the error message?
- Which endpoint/feature is affected?

Then:
1. Check relevant log files
2. Review the code path
3. Identify potential causes
4. Suggest debugging steps
5. Propose fixes
6. Help implement the solution
